\title{Probability Zoo}

\subsection{Probability Zoo}

The \emph{Probability Zoo} is a community repository for pre-trained
probabilistic models. It includes any parameters to the model as well
as parameters to its inferred posterior (such as a variational
approximation or posterior samples).

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Under construction. Check back soon!}
% Variational auto-encoder on binarized MNIST
% \href{}{[source]}
% \href{}{[model]}
% \href{}{[posterior]}
\end{itemize}

To contribute a pre-trained model to the repository, please submit a
\href{https://github.com/blei-lab/edward/pulls}{pull request}.
The parameters should be preferably stored in a
\href{https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/how_tos/variables/}
{TensorFlow checkpoint file}.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

The Probability Zoo is inspired by the model zoo in
\href{http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org}{Caffe} \citep{jia2014caffe},
which provides many pre-trained discriminative neural networks.
It is also inspired by \href{http://forestdb.org}{Forest}
\citep{stuhlmueller2012forest}, which
provides examples of probabilistic programs.
