\title{Linear Mixed Effects Models}

\subsection{Linear Mixed Effects Models}

With linear mixed effects models, we wish to model a linear
relationship for data points with inputs of varying type, categorized
into subgroups, and associated to a real-valued output.

We demonstrate with an example in Edward.
An interactive version with Jupyter notebook is available
\href{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/blei-lab/edward/blob/master/notebooks/linear_mixed_effects_models.ipynb}{here}.

\subsubsection{Data}

We use the \texttt{InstEval} data set from the popular
\href{http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org}{lme4 R package}
\citep{bates2015fitting}.
It is a data set of instructor evaluation ratings, where the inputs
(covariates) include categories such as \texttt{students} and
\texttt{departments}, and our response variable of interest is the
instructor evaluation rating.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import pandas as pd
from observations import insteval

data, metadata = insteval("~/data")
data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=metadata['columns'])

# s - students - 1:2972
# d - instructors - codes that need to be remapped
# dept also needs to be remapped
data['s'] = data['s'] - 1
data['dcodes'] = data['d'].astype('category').cat.codes
data['deptcodes'] = data['dept'].astype('category').cat.codes
data['y'] = data['y'].values.astype(float)

train = data.sample(frac=0.8)
test = data.drop(train.index)
\end{lstlisting}

The data set denotes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{students} as \texttt{s}
\item \texttt{instructors} as \texttt{d}
\item \texttt{departments} as \texttt{dept}
\item \texttt{service} as \texttt{service}
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
s_train = train['s'].values
d_train = train['dcodes'].values
dept_train = train['deptcodes'].values
y_train = train['y'].values
service_train = train['service'].values
n_obs_train = train.shape[0]

s_test = test['s'].values
d_test = test['dcodes'].values
dept_test = test['deptcodes'].values
y_test = test['y'].values
service_test = test['service'].values
n_obs_test = test.shape[0]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
n_s = max(s_train) + 1  # number of students
n_d = max(d_train) + 1  # number of instructors
n_dept = max(dept_train) + 1  # number of departments
n_obs = train.shape[0]  # number of observations

print("Number of students: {}".format(n_s))
print("Number of instructors: {}".format(n_d))
print("Number of departments: {}".format(n_dept))
print("Number of observations: {}".format(n_obs))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
Number of students: 2972
Number of instructors: 1128
Number of departments: 14
Number of observations: 58737
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Model}

With linear regression, one makes an independence assumption where
each data point regresses with a constant slope among each other. In
our setting, the observations come from groups which may have
varying slopes and intercepts. Thus we'd like to build a model that
can capture this behavior \citep{gelman2006data}.

For examples of this phenomena:
\begin{itemize}
\item The observations from a single student are not independent of
each other. Rather, some students may systematically give low (or
high) lecture ratings.
\item The observations from a single teacher are not independent of
each other. We expect good teachers to get generally good ratings and
bad teachers to get generally bad ratings.
\item The observations from a single department are not independent of
each other. One department may generally have dry material and thus be
rated lower than others.
\end{itemize}

Typical linear regression takes the form
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \epsilon,
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to fixed effects with coefficients
$\beta$ and $\epsilon$ corresponds to random noise,
$\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$.

In a linear mixed effects model, we add an additional term
$\mathbf{Z}\eta$, where $\mathbf{Z}$ corresponds to random effects
with coefficients $\eta$. The model takes the form
\begin{align*}
\eta &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}), \\
\mathbf{y} &= \mathbf{X}\beta + \mathbf{Z}\eta + \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Given data, the goal is to infer $\beta$, $\eta$, and $\sigma^2$,
where $\beta$ are model parameters (``fixed effects''), $\eta$ are
latent variables (``random effects''), and $\sigma^2$ is a variance
component parameter.

Because the random effects have mean 0, the data's mean is captured by
$\mathbf{X}\beta$. The random effects component $\mathbf{Z}\eta$
captures variations in the data (e.g.  Instructor \#54 is rated 1.4
points higher than the mean).

A natural question is the difference between fixed and random effects.
A fixed effect is an effect that is constant for a given population. A
random effect is an effect that varies for a given population (i.e.,
it may be constant within subpopulations but varies within the overall
population). We illustrate below in our example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Select \texttt{service} as the fixed effect. It is a binary covariate
corresponding to whether the lecture belongs to the lecturer's main
department. No matter how much additional data we collect, it
can only take on the values in $0$ and $1$.
\item
Select the categorical values of \texttt{students}, \texttt{teachers},
and \texttt{departments} as the random effects. Given more
observations from the population of instructor evaluation ratings, we
may be looking at new students, teachers, or departments.
\end{itemize}

In the syntax of R's lme4 package \citep{bates2015fitting}, the model
can be summarized as

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JSON]
y ~ 1 + (1|students) + (1|instructor) + (1|dept) + service
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{1} denotes an intercept term, \texttt{(1|x)} denotes a
random effect for  \texttt{x}, and \texttt{x} denotes a fixed effect.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Set up placeholders for the data inputs.
s_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
d_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
dept_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
service_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None])

# Set up fixed effects.
mu = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([]))
service = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([]))

sigma_s = tf.sqrt(tf.exp(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([]))))
sigma_d = tf.sqrt(tf.exp(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([]))))
sigma_dept = tf.sqrt(tf.exp(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([]))))

# Set up random effects.
eta_s = Normal(loc=tf.zeros(n_s), scale=sigma_s * tf.ones(n_s))
eta_d = Normal(loc=tf.zeros(n_d), scale=sigma_d * tf.ones(n_d))
eta_dept = Normal(loc=tf.zeros(n_dept), scale=sigma_dept * tf.ones(n_dept))

yhat = (tf.gather(eta_s, s_ph) +
        tf.gather(eta_d, d_ph) +
        tf.gather(eta_dept, dept_ph) +
        mu + service * service_ph)
y = Normal(loc=yhat, scale=tf.ones(n_obs))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Inference}

Given data, we aim to infer the model's fixed and random effects.
In this analysis, we use variational inference with the
$\text{KL}(q\|p)$ divergence measure. We specify fully factorized
normal approximations for the random effects and pass in all training
data for inference. Under the algorithm, the fixed effects will be
estimated under a variational EM scheme.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
q_eta_s = Normal(
    loc=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_s])),
    scale=tf.nn.softplus(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_s]))))
q_eta_d = Normal(
    loc=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_d])),
    scale=tf.nn.softplus(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_d]))))
q_eta_dept = Normal(
    loc=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_dept])),
    scale=tf.nn.softplus(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_dept]))))

latent_vars = {
    eta_s: q_eta_s,
    eta_d: q_eta_d,
    eta_dept: q_eta_dept}
data = {
    y: y_train,
    s_ph: s_train,
    d_ph: d_train,
    dept_ph: dept_train,
    service_ph: service_train}
inference = ed.KLqp(latent_vars, data)
\end{lstlisting}

One way to critique the fitted model is a residual plot, i.e., a
plot of the difference between the predicted value and the observed
value for each data point. Below we manually run inference,
initializing the algorithm and performing individual updates within a
loop. We form residual plots as the algorithm progresses. This helps
us examine how the algorithm proceeds to infer the random and fixed
effects from data.

To form residuals, we first make predictions on test data. We do this
by copying \texttt{yhat} defined in the model and replacing its
dependence on random effects with their inferred means. During the
algorithm, we evaluate the predictions, feeding in test inputs.

We have also fit the same model
\texttt{(y ~ service + (1|dept) + (1|s) + (1|d)},
fit on the entire InstEval dataset, specifically) in lme4. We
have saved the random effect estimates and will compare them to our
learned parameters.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
yhat_test = ed.copy(yhat, {
    eta_s: q_eta_s.mean(),
    eta_d: q_eta_d.mean(),
    eta_dept: q_eta_dept.mean()})
\end{lstlisting}

We now write the main loop.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
inference.initialize(n_print=20, n_iter=100)
tf.global_variables_initializer().run()

for _ in range(inference.n_iter):
  # Update and print progress of algorithm.
  info_dict = inference.update()
  inference.print_progress(info_dict)

  t = info_dict['t']
  if t == 1 or t % inference.n_print == 0:
    # Make predictions on test data.
    yhat_vals = yhat_test.eval(feed_dict={
        s_ph: s_test,
        d_ph: d_test,
        dept_ph: dept_test,
        service_ph: service_test})

    # Form residual plot.
    plt.title("Residuals for Predicted Ratings on Test Set")
    plt.xlim(-4, 4)
    plt.ylim(0, 800)
    plt.hist(yhat_vals - y_test, 75)
    plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Criticism}

Above, we described a method for diagnosing the fit of the model via
residual plots.
Below we show the residuals for the model post-convergence. (For
intermediate residual plots, check the Jupyter notebook.)

\includegraphics[width=450px]{/images/linear-mixed-effects-models-fig0.png}

The residuals appear normally distributed with mean 0. The residuals
appear normally distributed with mean 0. This is a good
sanity check for the model.

We can also compare our learned parameters to those estimated by R's
`lme4`.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
student_effects_lme4 = pd.read_csv('data/insteval_student_ranefs_r.csv')
instructor_effects_lme4 = pd.read_csv('data/insteval_instructor_ranefs_r.csv')
dept_effects_lme4 = pd.read_csv('data/insteval_dept_ranefs_r.csv')

student_effects_edward = q_eta_s.mean().eval()
instructor_effects_edward = q_eta_d.mean().eval()
dept_effects_edward = q_eta_dept.mean().eval()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
plt.title("Student Effects Comparison")
plt.xlim(-1, 1)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.xlabel("Student Effects from lme4")
plt.ylabel("Student Effects from edward")
plt.scatter(student_effects_lme4["(Intercept)"],
            student_effects_edward,
            alpha=0.25)
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\includegraphics[width=450px]{/images/linear-mixed-effects-models-fig1.png}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
plt.title("Instructor Effects Comparison")
plt.xlim(-1.5, 1.5)
plt.ylim(-1.5, 1.5)
plt.xlabel("Instructor Effects from lme4")
plt.ylabel("Instructor Effects from edward")
plt.scatter(instructor_effects_lme4["(Intercept)"],
            instructor_effects_edward,
            alpha=0.25)
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\includegraphics[width=450px]{/images/linear-mixed-effects-models-fig2.png}

Great!  Our estimates for both student and instructor effects seem to
match those from `lme4` closely.  We have set up a slightly different
model here (for example, our overall mean is regularized, as are our
variances for student, department, and instructor effects, which is not
true of `lme4`s model), and we have a different inference method, so we
should not expect to find exactly the same parameters as `lme4`.  But
it is reassuring that they match up closely!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
#  Add in the intercept from R and edward
dept_effects_and_intercept_lme4 = 3.28259 + dept_effects_lme4["(Intercept)"]
dept_effects_and_intercept_edward = mu.eval() + dept_effects_edward

plt.title("Departmental Effects Comparison")
plt.xlim(3.0, 3.5)
plt.ylim(3.0, 3.5)
plt.xlabel("Department Effects from lme4")
plt.ylabel("Department Effects from edward")
plt.scatter(dept_effects_and_intercept_lme4,
            dept_effects_and_intercept_edward,
            s=0.01 * train.dept.value_counts())
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\includegraphics[width=450px]{/images/linear-mixed-effects-models-fig3.png}

Our department effects do not match up nearly as well with those from `lme4`.
There are likely several reasons for this:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We regularize the overall mean, while `lme4` doesn't. This causes the
  Edward model to put some of the intercept into the department effects,
  which are allowed to vary more widely since we learn a variance
\item
  We are using 80% of the data to train the edward model, while our `lme4`
  estimate uses the whole `InstEval` data set
\item
  The department effects are the weakest in the model and difficult to
  estimate.
\end{itemize}
