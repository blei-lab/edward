\title{Latent Space Models for Neural Data}

\subsection{Latent Space Models for Neural Data}

Many scientific fields involve the study of network data, including
social networks, networks in statistical physics, biological
networks, and information networks
\citep{newman2010networks,goldenberg2010survey}.

What we can learn about nodes in a network from their connectivity patterns?
We can begin to study this using a latent space model \citep{hoff2002latent}.
Latent space models embed nodes in the network in a latent space,
where the likelihood of forming an edge between two nodes depends on
their distance in the latent space.

We will analyze network data from neuroscience.
An interactive version with Jupyter notebook is available
\href{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/blei-lab/edward/blob/master/notebooks/latent_space_models.ipynb}{here}.

\subsubsection{Data}

The data comes from \href{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/}{Mark Newman's repository}.
It is a weighted, directed network representing the neural network of
the nematode
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans}{C.~Elegans}
compiled by \citet{watts1998collective} using experimental data
by \citet{white1986structure}.

The neural network consists of around $300$ neurons. Each connection
between neurons
is associated with a weight (positive integer) capturing the strength
of the connection.

First, we load the data.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
x_train = np.load('data/celegans_brain.npy')
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Model}

What can we learn about the neurons from their connectivity patterns? Using
a latent space model \citep{hoff2002latent}, we will learn a latent
embedding for each neuron to capture the similarities between them.

Each neuron $n$ is a node in the network and is associated with a latent
position $z_n\in\mathbb{R}^K$.
We place a Gaussian prior on each of the latent positions.

The log-odds of an edge between node $i$ and
$j$ is proportional to the Euclidean distance between the latent
representations of the nodes $|z_i- z_j|$. Here, we
model the weights ($Y_{ij}$) of the edges with a Poisson likelihood.
The rate is the reciprocal of the distance in latent space. The
generative process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
For each node $n=1,\ldots,N$,
\begin{align}
z_n \sim N(0,I).
\end{align}
\item
For each edge $(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,N\}\times\{1,\ldots,N\}$,
\begin{align}
Y_{ij} \sim \text{Poisson}\Bigg(\frac{1}{|z_i - z_j|}\Bigg).
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

In Edward, we write the model as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from edward.models import Normal, Poisson

N = x_train.shape[0]  # number of data points
K = 3  # latent dimensionality

z = Normal(loc=tf.zeros([N, K]), scale=tf.ones([N, K]))

# Calculate N x N distance matrix.
# 1. Create a vector, [||z_1||^2, ||z_2||^2, ..., ||z_N||^2], and tile
# it to create N identical rows.
xp = tf.tile(tf.reduce_sum(tf.pow(z, 2), 1, keep_dims=True), [1, N])
# 2. Create a N x N matrix where entry (i, j) is ||z_i||^2 + ||z_j||^2
# - 2 z_i^T z_j.
xp = xp + tf.transpose(xp) - 2 * tf.matmul(z, z, transpose_b=True)
# 3. Invert the pairwise distances and make rate along diagonals to
# be close to zero.
xp = 1.0 / tf.sqrt(xp + tf.diag(tf.zeros(N) + 1e3))

x = Poisson(rate=xp)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Inference}

Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is simple in Edward. Two lines are
required: Instantiating inference and running it.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
inference = ed.MAP([z], data={x: x_train})
\end{lstlisting}

See this extended tutorial about
\href{/tutorials/map}{MAP estimation in Edward}.

One could instead run variational inference. This requires specifying
a variational model and instantiating \texttt{KLqp}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
qz = Normal(loc=tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([N * K])),
            scale=tf.nn.softplus(tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([N * K]))))
inference = ed.KLqp({z: qz}, data={x: x_train})
\end{lstlisting}
See this extended tutorial about
\href{/tutorials/variational-inference}{variational inference in Edward}.

Finally, the following line runs the inference procedure for 2500
iterations.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
inference.run(n_iter=2500)
\end{lstlisting}
