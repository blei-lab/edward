\subsection{A library for probabilistic modeling, inference, and criticism.}

Edward is a Python library for probabilistic modeling, inference, and
criticism. It is a testbed for fast experimentation and research with
probabilistic models, ranging from classical hierarchical models on
small data sets to complex deep probabilistic models on large data
sets. Edward fuses three fields: Bayesian statistics and machine
learning, deep learning, and probabilistic programming.

It supports \textbf{modeling} with

\begin{itemize}
\item Directed graphical models
\item Neural networks (via libraries such as
  \href{http://keras.io}{Keras} and
  \href{https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim}{TensorFlow
  Slim})
\item Intractable likelihoods
\item Bayesian nonparametrics and probabilistic programs
\end{itemize}

It supports \textbf{inference} with

\begin{itemize}
\item Variational inference
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Black box variational inference
    \item Stochastic variational inference
    \item Generative adversarial networks
    \item Maximum a posteriori estimation
  \end{itemize}
\item Monte Carlo
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    \item Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
    \item Metropolis-Hastings
  \end{itemize}
\item Compositions of inference
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Expectation-Maximization
    \item Pseudo-marginal and ABC methods
    \item Message passing algorithms
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

It supports \textbf{criticism} of the model and inference with

\begin{itemize}
\item Point-based evaluations
\item Posterior predictive checks
\end{itemize}

Edward is built on
\href{https://www.tensorflow.org}{TensorFlow}. It enables features such
as computational graphs, distributed training, CPU/GPU integration,
automatic differentiation, and visualization with TensorBoard.
